# Topic Modeling 

## LDA
LDA represents documents as a mixture of topics. Similarly, a topic is a mixture of words. If a word has high probability of being in a topic, all the documents having w will be more strongly associated with t as well.

### Caveats

- LDA works off the premise that documents with the same topic will have a lot of words in common.
- LDA is a bag of words model meaning that it only considers individual tokens and not their relationships in a sentence.

## LLMs
Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, BERT, or other transformer-based models can be effectively utilized for topic modeling by leveraging their ability to understand and generate human-like text. Unlike traditional methods like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), LLMs can provide more nuanced and context-aware topic representations. Here are some approaches to use LLMs for topic modeling:

### Using Embeddings for Clustering
LLMs can generate embeddings that capture semantic meaning of text. These embeddings can then be clustered to identify topics.

Steps:

1. Text Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data (e.g., removing stopwords, punctuation, and tokenization).
2. Embedding Generation: Use an LLM to generate embeddings for each document or sentence.
3. Dimensionality Reduction: Optionally, use techniques like PCA or t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings.
4. Clustering: Apply clustering algorithms like K-means or DBSCAN on the embeddings to group similar texts.
5. Topic Labeling: Analyze the clusters to identify common themes or keywords representing each topic.

Example with Sentence-BERT:
```Python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np

# Sample documents
documents = [
    "The stock market crashed due to economic instability.",
    "The new movie was a box office hit.",
    "Advancements in AI are accelerating.",
    "Climate change is a pressing issue globally."
]

# Load pre-trained Sentence-BERT model
model = SentenceTransformer('paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Generate embeddings
embeddings = model.encode(documents)

# Apply K-means clustering
num_clusters = 2
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=num_clusters, random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(embeddings)
labels = kmeans.labels_

# Print clustered documents
for i in range(num_clusters):
    cluster_docs = [documents[j] for j in range(len(documents)) if labels[j] == i]
    print(f"Cluster {i}: {cluster_docs}")
```
