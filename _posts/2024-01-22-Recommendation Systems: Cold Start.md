# Causes of Cold Start
The cold start problem occurs when the recommender system lacks sufficient information to make reliable predictions or suggestions for a user or an item.  
This can happen due to:  
- A new user not providing ratings or feedback
- A new item not receiving ratings or feedback
- A user or item belonging to a niche or rare category
- Or the user or item changing preferences over time  

In any of these cases, the system is unable to make accurate recommendations.  

# Types of cold start
The cold start problem can be classified into three types depending on the source of the missing information: user cold start, item cold start, and system cold start.  
1. User cold start occurs when the system is unaware of the preferences or profile of a new or existing user
2. Item cold start occurs when the system is unaware of the features or quality of a new or existing item  
3. System cold start, on the other hand, happens when the system is launched for the first time and has no ratings or interactions from any users or items.  
Each type of cold start presents its own challenges and requires specialized solutions for the recommender system.

# Strategies for cold start
In order to address the cold start problem, recommender systems can employ hybrid methods that combine collaborative filtering with other techniques, such as:
- Content-based filtering
- Demographic filtering
- Or knowledge-based filtering  
Additionally, active learning can be used to ask users to provide ratings or feedback on a selected set of items.  
Transfer learning can also be utilized to leverage information from other sources or domains related to the target users or items. 
Lastly, ensemble methods can be employed to combine multiple models or algorithms that can complement each other and improve the performance and robustness of the recommender system.

# Methods for cold start
To implement the strategies for cold start, the recommender system can employ various methods, such as:
- matrix factorization
- clustering
- nearest neighbor
- and deep learning  

Matrix factorization decomposes the user-item rating matrix into latent factors that can be used to predict missing ratings or interactions.  

Clustering groups users or items into similar clusters based on their ratings or interactions, which can be used to recommend items from the same cluster or from neighboring clusters.  

Nearest neighbor finds the most similar users or items based on their ratings or interactions, and can be used to suggest items that are liked by similar users or items.  

Deep learning utilizes neural networks to learn complex and nonlinear patterns from the data, and can be used to extract features or embeddings from the users or the items, and generate recommendations.

# Opportunities for cold start
Despite the challenges, the cold start problem also presents some opportunities for the recommender system. It can motivate the system to explore new users or items that have not been rated or interacted with, and to discover new preferences or features that can enrich the recommendations.  
Additionally, it can encourage the system to expand the diversity of recommendations by introducing novel items that can match users' interests or needs, and by avoiding overfitting or bias towards popular or familiar items.  
It can also enhance the user experience by engaging users in providing ratings or feedback, offering personalized and relevant recommendations, and creating trust and loyalty with the system.
